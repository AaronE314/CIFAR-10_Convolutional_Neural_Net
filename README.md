# Convolutional_Neural_Net

## Intro

This repo is used to practice making Convolutional Neural Networks with various practice dataset's

## Design

The repo is designed in a way so that each dataset has a main file that uses the Convolutional network class for the dataset. 

The weights of each dataset is saved under the saved_models folder, and the output of the first 160 images in the testing data is under the output folder as a pdf.

## Current Datasets Tested

| Dataset | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| mnist | 99.22%  |
| cifar10 | 76.72% |
